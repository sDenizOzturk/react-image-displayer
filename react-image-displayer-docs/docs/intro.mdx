# React Image Displayer

An image loader React component that displays/mounts the image only after it is successfully loaded. It has three key features:

1. Built-in spinners: The built-in spinner is displayed while the image is loading. 20+ spinners could be used via [React Spinners](https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/) library.

2. Enter Animations: After the image is loaded, it appears with an enter animation. 10+ animations could be used via [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) library.

3. JWT Support: `<img>` tag does not support JWT authentication. However, using this component, they are fetched effortlessly by only passing the JWT token through the `token` prop.
